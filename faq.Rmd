                The survey collected 2131 fully complete responses. Unfortunately, we can only calculate the response rate for EMJMD students which received Erasmus Mundus scholarships, since there are no reliable data on the number of self-paying students in EMJMDs. The 2015 CQSS survey response rate for students with Erasmus Mundus scholarships can be found in the table below. We do not have any reasons to suspect that response rates for self-paying students was considerably lower.

The response rate for each course is calculated using self-reported information from consortia. This information was obtained through a one of the two surveys described below. First, in June 2015 EMJMD consortia were invited to complete a survey asking them to report "How many students did you have enrolled from the start of the program?". Some, but not all course coordinators responded to this survey. Second, in May 2016 a new survey was sent to course coordinators asking them to specify both the total number of students in all cohorts up to the 2014 cohort (the last cohort eligible to complete the CQSS survey) and the number of students enrolled in each year of the program. Some but not all coordinators responded to this survey. In cases courses provided information as part of both surveys, the latest numbers are used.

We believe that CQSS survey is first and foremost a conversation starter among internal stakeholders of each EMJMD.

The CQSS survey is not a rating or ranking exercise in any shape or form. We deliberately decided to use quartile ranges in comparative tables to highlight that CQSS survey data should not be seen as a rating of EMJMD programs. Each program is unique and it is impossible to capture that uniqueness with any standard tool for data collection.
